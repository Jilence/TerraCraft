# TerraCraft

TerraCraft is a Minecraft [Paper]("https://papermc.io/") Based Plugin.
It is inspired by [Terraria]("https://terraria.org/") and we are trying to do make this Game 2D.

## How to Play?
Currently, there is no Code to run, so the Plugin is still under Constructon.
Later, it will be a One Block World, where the Player can control an NPC.
